# Mary Hill Market Website (MERN)

I made this website as a freelance project for a local grocery store. The front end is made with *React, react-dom* and *MUI*. The back-end is still in progress, made with node *express* and *mongoDB (mongoose)* as DB. 

##
Front-end can be tested on localhost by running `npm start` from the root directory.
